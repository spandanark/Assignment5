Problem Statement: YouTube Trending Data and Content Insights Integration

In the dynamic realm of digital content creation and video sharing platforms, understanding the intricate relationships between trending videos,
subscriber engagement, and content attributes is pivotal for optimizing strategies and maximizing reach. To address this, we seek to merge 
two distinct datasets - an "Original YouTube Trending Dataset" and a "Dummy Content Insights Dataset" - in order to unearth comprehensive 
insights that will benefit content creators, marketers, and platform analysts alike.

Background:
The "Original YouTube Trending Dataset" encompasses crucial details such as video metadata, engagement metrics, and channel information for 
trending videos. On the other hand, the "Dummy Content Insights Dataset" has been crafted to complement the original data, containing additional 
information about videos' overall context, potential monetization, and playlist associations.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to merge the two datasets based on the common identifier "video_id" and conduct an in-depth analysis to derive 
valuable insights and patterns. By amalgamating these datasets, we aim to enhance our understanding of how video attributes, viewer interactions,
and context contribute to the viral success of YouTube videos.
